# SLTT-Risk-Allocation-Demo (SQLite)
Although the actual version of this project contains classified information, here I am adapting a brief unclass. version that showcases similar work/procedures. The purpose is to show how I've leveraged SQL to achieve data-driven analysis.
What this shows - A small SQLite database and set of queries for risk-based analysis across SLTT entities and sectors. - Joins, aggregations, per capita rates, and simple quantile tiering.  Files - sltt_risk_alloc.db - sltt_risk_alloc.sql
